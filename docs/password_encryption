= PASSWORD ENCRYPTION

The encryption strategy for user's password can be illustrated as below:

  User        Frontend             Backend      Database
   |             |                    |            |
   o-(password)--o-(Base64)--<HTTP>---o-(SHA-256)--o-->

From the UI, user will enter the password in plain text format. This password
will be encrypted to a Base64 string using btoa() [1] function in JavaScript.

Then, the Base64 encrypted password will be sent through HTTP request to the
backend via POST method.

The encryption will be continued on backend side with the help of rust-crypto
crate [2], using SHA-256 algorithm [3].

In the end of the encryption process, we will have the SHA-256 hash that we
will then use it for database lookup or registering new user.
