= Unified Comment System

The idea of the comment system is inspired by Salmon Protocol [1].

In our system, we will provide a public comment API that can be 
integrated with any frontend, including our web-based frontend.

The benefit of such API is to provide an unified comment system
that the user will be able to comment on the same topic/article
no matter where he/she is. They can comment directly on Kipalink
or the Authors can integrate the comment API on to his/her website
to let the users discuss directly on the site. All of the comment
will be stored in our database, based on the URL of the article.

  Database      Server      Web UI    Author's Website
      |           |           |              |
   <--o.--(save)--o-(comment)-o              |
        `-(save)--o-----------|--------------o
      o--(load)---o--(query)--o-->           |
      o--(load)---o--(remote query)----------o-->

We will not implement Salmon Protocol, but a simple RESTful API
and an embedable JavaScript library to load/post comment on the
frontends.
